Walrus is a decentralized storage network that allows you to store and transmit raw data and media files—videos, images, and PDFs—without compromising performance and accessibility. With Walrus, your data is always secure and available.

Also Walrus opened a [quest on Galxe](https://app.galxe.com/quest/Walrus/GCW4GtxnAo?referral_code=GRFr2JUzJim8VD6o5t8KpWgvZZv6KrNa8IIwr3-8DeO8GjK), where we can complete tasks and get NFT. Answers to the Quiz: B, C, B, A. A minimum balance of 1 SUI is required for NFT.

In the [WALRUS testnet](https://www.walrus.xyz/build-on-walrus), you can participate in the following activities:

- [Staking](https://stake.walrus.site)
- [Explorer](https://walruscan.com/testnet/home)
- [Faucet](https://docs.walrus.site/usage/setup.html#testnet-wal-faucet)
- [Walrus Sites](https://docs.walrus.site/walrus-sites/intro.html)

Let’s look at the key activities in the network in more detail.

## [Staking](https://stake.walrus.site). Staking WAL in the Sui testnet.

On the [staking site](https://stake.walrus.site/), you can exchange your test SUI for WAL and stake them by delegating to one of 32 Storage Nodes.
For all activities, you will need a [Sui wallet](https://suiwallet.com/) and test tokens. The easiest wallet to use is the Sui wallet. Register in the wallet and switch to the Sui testnet by going to the settings in the upper-right corner > Network > Testnet. Now you can track your test SUI tokens.

To get test SUI tokens, you need to obtain them from the Sui Faucet. The easiest way is through the SUI Discord.
Go to the [SUI Discord](https://discord.gg/sui), then find the channel called #testnet-faucet. All you need to do to receive test SUI is send a message in the format: !faucet 0xYourSUIAddress. The faucet will give you 1 test SUI every 2 hours for each message.

You can then exchange your test SUI tokens for WAL tokens, which you’ll need for staking. To do this, click "Get WAL" in the upper-right corner next to your balance.

You can exchange any amount of test SUI tokens. Click the "Exchange" button, confirm the transaction in the SUI wallet, and if successful, you’ll see the message "Exchanged successfully. Received amount WAL," and your WAL balance will update.

Next, you can stake your WAL in any of the offered nodes. Just click any of the "Stake" buttons, enter the desired amount of WAL, and click "Stake."

Congratulations, you’ve staked your first WAL! To stay active, you can perform these actions as often as possible—choose different nodes, stake different amounts of WAL, etc. Now, let’s move on to other activities!

## [Explorer](https://walruscan.com/testnet/home). Track your actions within the network.

On the [Walruscan](https://walruscan.com/testnet/home) site, you can see a full blockchain scanner for the Walrus network. The site shows the network's activity, epoch, number of operators, number of Blobs, events, total data usage, and the price for storing data. You can use this site to monitor both the overall network activity and your personal actions.

## [Walrus Sites](https://docs.walrus.site/walrus-sites/intro.html). This activity allows you to host your website within the Walrus network.

! This section will be updated with more detailed information soon!

## [Uploader](https://publish.walrus.site). Upload information to Walrus.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c717561f-448c-4b8d-a13e-ce003af822c4)

On this [page](https://publish.walrus.site), you can upload your information to the Walrus network. Each Blob is limited to 10MiB. We uploaded a .png file with our logo. Click "Choose file," select your file, and click "Upload." After a successful upload, you will see your Blob and additional information. To track your Blob, simply copy the Blob ID and paste it into either Explorer or Display.

## [Capacity](https://capacity.walrus.site). Track the amount of data in the network.

[Here](https://capacity.walrus.site), you can monitor all the latest network events by volume, see the total amount of data, and the available free space in the network. There are no activities here; this page is only for network monitoring.

## Conclusion. Why this project is unique.
Walrus is the first testnet on SUI, which gives us hope for its success. The future of the project looks promising due to the growing trends of decentralized information security using such Storage networks with Storage Nodes.
